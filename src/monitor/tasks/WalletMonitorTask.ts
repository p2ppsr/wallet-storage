/**
 * A monitor task performs some periodic or state triggered maintenance function
 * on the data managed by a wallet (Bitcoin UTXO manager, aka wallet)
 *
 * The monitor maintains a collection of tasks.
 *
 * It runs each task's non-asynchronous trigger to determine if the runTask method needs to run.
 *
 * Tasks that need to be run are run consecutively by awaiting their async runTask override method.
 *
 * The monitor then waits a fixed interval before repeating...
 *
 * Tasks may use the monitor_events table to persist their execution history.
 * This is done by accessing the wathman.storage object.
